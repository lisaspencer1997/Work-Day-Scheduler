# Week 7 Challenge: Work Day Scheduler

## Project status
Finished project. Tested, no bugs. 

## Name
Lisa Spencer: Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This page is the challenge/homework for Week 7 of my Bootcamp course. The aim is to create a work day scheduler using jQuery. The challenge asks us to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.


The calendar must contain the following requirements:

* Use of the Day.js library to work with date and time. 

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present time blocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each time block based on past, present, and future when the time block is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a time block

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that time block.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page

## Screen Recordings
This screen recording shows the main functions. We can input an event into the text area, click 'save' and the page doesn't remove when refreshed.

This screen recording shows the time changing. When we refresh the page at the hour that the time changes, we can see that the red bar has shifted to the new hour slot. And yet, the event text has not changed.
